# TeamA-3_Emne3

This is my repository for the 3 act of Get Academy.
it consist's of using VS Community and C# which I'm
extremly excited about, With some help I've managed to
get all the tasks in to this one repository.

## What can you expect

so far I have done about 3 big task and these are:
### * Guess that number
### * Alligator game
### * A taste test of what to come

## Guess that number

This is my first, well one of the first task I did on both VS Community and with C# hopefully not my last

### What it does?

It's quite simple, you write a number of your choice between 0 and 100 and you either get that it's to small or to big,
if you'r realy lucky you could guess the number in your first try and you could start a new or stop the program.

## Alligator game


### What it does?

Well it's a relativly simple program, tried using what I've learned of C# so far and using switch. You type in either 
(<, >, =) these might resemble aligator teeth and that's with purpose. When you start the program your aske what's 
bigger of two numbers and you'r either right or wrong. and obviously we had to include a score system so you can keep 
tract of how your doing.
